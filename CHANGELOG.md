# 0.9.0+ - [Unreleased]
## Added
### Client
- `--server` can be set in git config
- Prevent actual duplicate entries created by `git timestamp --branch`
- Documented that `git timestamp --help` does not work and to use `-h`, as
  `--help` is swallowed by `git` and not forwarded to `git-timestamp`.
- Client system tests (require Internet connectivity)

### Server
- Ability to run multiple GnuPG (including gpg-agents) in parallel
- Handle missing `--push-repository` (again)

## Fixed
- Made tests compatible with older GnuPG versions

## Changed
### Client
- Made some error messages more consistent
- `--tag` overrides `--branch`. This allows to store a default branch in
  `git config`, yet timestamp a tag when necessary.

# 0.9.0 - 2019-04-04
